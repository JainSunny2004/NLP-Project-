📰 Fake News Classifier
A machine learning project designed to detect and classify fake news articles using natural language processing techniques.

📁 Project Structure
Fake News Classifier.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the fake news classification model.

kaggle_fake_test.csv: Dataset used for testing the model, sourced from Kaggle.

🚀 Features
Implements a fake news detection model using NLP techniques.

Utilizes a dataset comprising real and fake news articles for training and evaluation.

Provides a step-by-step approach to preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)

📊 Dataset
The project uses the kaggle_fake_test.csv dataset, which includes labeled news articles indicating whether they are real or fake. This dataset is essential for training and evaluating the model's performance.

📈 Model Evaluation
The notebook includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness in classifying news articles.
